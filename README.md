git commit -m "Initial commit: Add basic structure and NFT marketplace smart contracts

This commit sets up the foundational structure for the NFT marketplace project supporting Ethereum and Base networks. The following components have been added:

1. **Smart Contracts:**
   - `contracts/Marketplace.sol`: The main smart contract for the NFT marketplace, handling the buying, selling, and auctioning of NFTs.
   - `contracts/NFT.sol`: An ERC-721 compliant NFT token contract for creating and managing NFTs.
   - `contracts/Migrations.sol`: A helper contract to manage and track migrations.

2. **Migration Scripts:**
   - `migrations/1_initial_migration.js`: Script to deploy the Migrations contract.
   - `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`: Script to deploy the Marketplace and NFT contracts.

3. **Testing:**
   - `test/Marketplace.test.js`: Unit tests for the Marketplace contract to ensure core functionalities work as expected.
   - `test/NFT.test.js`: Unit tests for the NFT contract to verify ERC-721 compliance and functionality.

4. **Scripts:**
   - `scripts/deploy.js`: Script to deploy contracts using Hardhat.
   - `scripts/interact.js`: Script to interact with deployed contracts.

5. **Configuration and Setup:**
   - `.gitignore`: Configuration to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.
   - `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation including project description, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
   - `truffle-config.js`: Configuration file for the Truffle framework to manage deployments and network settings.
   - `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for the Hardhat framework to manage deployments and network settings.
   - `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies required for the development environment.

This initial commit lays the groundwork for further development and enhancements of the NFT marketplace project."
